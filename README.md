# Network Intrusion Detection for IoT Systems

This is an illustrative example on applying machine learning for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).

## Dataset

The dataset in use is the [TON_IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets), specifically the `Train_Test_Network_dataset`.
